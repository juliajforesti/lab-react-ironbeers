Since beer is one of the most consumed drinks between Ironhackers 🍻 , the mission here was to create an app to showcase some of the best-handcrafted beers, but not just that - to save some as well so the rest of Ironhack community is informed 😌.

This app was developed by Julia Foresti during the Web Development - Bootcamp at Ironhack.
